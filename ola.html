                    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LET, VAR AND CONST
                </h1>

                <p>
                    A lot of shiny new features came out with ES2015 (ES6). And now, since it's 2020, 
                    it's assumed that a lot of JavaScript developers have become familiar with and have started using these features. <br><br>
                    While this assumption might be partially true, it's still possible that some of these features remain a mystery to some devs. <br><br>
                    One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration. 
                    The question is, what makes them different from good 
                    ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you. <br><br>
                    In this article, we'll discuss var, let and const with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting. 
                    As you read, take note of the differences between them that I'll point out. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">
                    VAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var, 
                    though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. 
                    First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    SCOPE OF VAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. <br><br>
    
                    The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window. <br><br>
    
                    var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    HOSTING OF VAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to 
                    the top of their scope before code execution. This means that if we do this:
                </p> <br><br><br><br>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">
                    LET
                </h2>
                <p>
                    let is now preferred for variable declaration. 
                    It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. 
                    It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    let is block scoped
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. 
                    Anything within curly braces is a block. <br><br>
                    So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    let can be updated but not re-declared.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just like var, a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, 
                    a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work: <br> <br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Hosting of let
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just like var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, 
                    the let keyword is not initialized. 
                    So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.
                </p> <br><br><br><br>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">
                    CONST
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. 
                    const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    const cannot be updated or re-declared
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. 
                    It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Hosting of const
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So just in case you missed the differences, here they are:
                </p>
               <ul>
                    <li>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.</li>
                    <li>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</li>
                    <li>They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.</li>
                    <li>While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</li>
               </ul>
            </div> <br><br><br><br><br><br>'
    
    
            <div>
                <h1>
                    SIMILARITIES BETWEEN LET, VAR AND CONST
                </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DECLARATION:</strong>All of them are used in the declaration of variables.</li>
                    <li><strong>DATA TYPE:</strong>Can be used with data type.</li>
                    <li><strong>SCOPE:</strong>All three have scope whether global or block.</li>
                    <li><strong>ACCESSIBILITY:</strong>Variables declared with <strong>LET, VAR,CONST</strong> can be accessed and used in expressions.</li>
                    <li><strong>JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX:</strong>Part of javaScript, used in scripts, functions and loops</li>
                </ul>
            </div> 
        </div> <br><br><br>
