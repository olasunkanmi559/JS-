            JavaScript is most widely used now a days and most preferable language for development as front-end as well back-end(Nodejs),
            if we want to learn JavaScript we need to understand the basics of JavaScript and ECMAScript(ES), 
            ECMAScript is an simple standard for JavaScript and adding new features to JavaScript,  <br><br><br>
            ECMAScript is a subset of JavaScript. JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds upon it. 
            Languages such as ActionScript, JavaScript, JScript all use ECMAScript as its core. As a comparison, AS/JS/JScript are 3 different cars, 
            but they all use the same engine… 
            each of their exteriors is different though, and there have been several modifications done to each to make it unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The history is, Brendan Eich created Mocha which became LiveScript, and later JavaScript. 
            Netscape presented JavaScript to Ecma International, 
            which develops standards and it was renamed to ECMA-262 aka ECMAScript. <br><br><br>
            It’s important to note that Brendan Eich’s “JavaScript” is not the same JavaScript that is a dialect of ECMAScript. 
            He built the core language which was renamed to ECMAScript, which differs from the JavaScript which browser-vendors implement nowadays, 
            so below content for why javascript has created,evolved to read more about history.

        <h3>
            JAVASCRIPT REBIRTH:
        </h3>
        <P>
            It all happened in six months from May to December 1995. 
            Netscape Communications Corporation had a strong presence in the young web. 
            Its browser, Netscape Communicator, was gaining traction as a competitor to NCSA Mosaic, 
            the first popular web browser. Netscape was founded by the very same people that took part in the development of Mosaic during the early 90s, and now, with money and independence, 
            they had the necessary freedom to seek further ways to expand the web. And that is precisely what gave birth to JavaScript.
        </P>
        <h3>
            JAVASCRIPT HISTORY
        </h3>
        <p>
            Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape Communications and part of the ex-Mosaic team, 
            had the vision that the web needed a way to become more dynamic. 
            Animations, interaction and other forms of small automation should be part of the web of the future. 
            So the web needed a small scripting language that could interact with the DOM (which was not set in stone as it is right now). 
            But, and this was an important strategic call at the time, this scripting language should not be oriented to big-shot developers and people with experience in the software engineering side of things. 
            Java was on the rise as well, and Java applets were to be a reality soon. So the scripting language for the web would need to cater to a different type of audience: designers. Indeed, the web was static. HTML was still young and simple enough for non-developers to pick up. 
            So whatever was to be part of the browser to make the web more dynamic should be accessible to non-programmers. And so the idea of Mocha was born. Mocha was to become a scripting language for the web. Simple, dynamic, and accessible to non-developers, 
            there`s an need to more Words about javaScript history but you can read further in blogs.

        <h3>
            JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION
        </h3>
        <P>
            When Sun and Netscape closed the deal to change the name of Mocha/LiveScript to JavaScript a big question was raised: 
            what would happen to alternative implementations? Indeed, although Netscape was quickly becoming the preferred browser at the time, 
            Internet Explorer was also being developed by Microsoft. From the very first days, JavaScript made such a considerable difference in user experience that competing browsers 
            had no choice but to come up with a working solution, a working implementation of JavaScript. 
            At the moment (and for a very long time), web standards were not strong. So Microsoft implemented their own version of JavaScript, called JScript. 
            Keeping “Java” off the name avoided possible trademark issues. However, JScript was different in more than just name. Slight differences in implementation, 
            in particular with regards to certain DOM functions, caused ripples that would still be felt many years into the future. 
            JavaScript wars were fought in more fronts than just names and timelines and many of its quirks are just the wounds of these wars. 
            The first version of JScript was included with Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996.

        <h3>
            JAVA-LIKE SYNTAX
        </h3>
        <p>
            Although keeping the syntax close to Java was not the original idea behind JavaScript, 
            marketing forces changed that. In retrospective, although a different syntax might have been 
            more convenient for certain features, 
            it is undeniable that a familiar syntax has helper JavaScript gain ground easily.
        </p>
        <h3>
            FUNCTIONS AS FIRST-CLASS OBJECTS
        </h3>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, functions are simply one more object type. 
            They can be passed around just like any other element. 
            They can be bound to variables, and, in later version of JavaScript, they can even be thrown as exceptions. 
            This feature is a probable result of the strong influence Scheme had in JavaScript development. <br><br><br>
            By making function first-class objects, certain functional programming patterns are possible. 
            For instance, later versions of JavaScript make use of certain functional patterns:
